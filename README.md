Project Title: Laptop Price Prediction

Description:
The Laptop Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the price of laptops based on various features such as CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, screen size, weight, and more. The application allows users to input specific laptop specifications, and the model predicts the price range or exact price of the laptop. This prediction can assist users in making informed purchasing decisions by providing an estimate of the expected price of a laptop based on its features. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about various laptop models and their corresponding prices.

Key Features:

Input laptop specifications such as CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.
Predict the price range or exact price of the laptop.
Provide insights into the importance of each feature in determining the laptop price.
Display visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to understand the relationship between features and price.
Evaluate model accuracy using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared score.
Deploy the model as a web application using Flask, allowing users to access the prediction tool from anywhere with an internet connection.

NB: THE APPLICATION TAKES A NUMPY VALUES

Target Audience:

Individuals interested in purchasing laptops.
Retailers and manufacturers seeking pricing insights.
Data enthusiasts and machine learning practitioners interested in exploring predictive modeling.
Technologies Used:

Python for data preprocessing, model training, and application development.
Scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models.
Flask for web application development and deployment.
HTML/CSS for frontend design.
GitHub for version control and collaboration.
Expected Outcome:
The Laptop Price Prediction project aims to provide users with an intuitive and accurate tool for estimating laptop prices based on their specifications. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the application empowers users to make informed decisions when purchasing laptops, ultimately enhancing their overall shopping experience.
